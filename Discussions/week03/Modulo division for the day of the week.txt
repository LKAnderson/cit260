In the chapter for this week, have a look at the modulo operator. Since it returns the remainder of a division between two integers, you might be able to use that.

Consider an example where the day entered by the user is Sunday (day 0). If you add 23 days to that day (0 + 23), you are actually adding 3 complete weeks (3 x 7 days = 21), plus 2 extra days into the fourth week. Since we don't care which week it is, we just care about the remainder, we can use the remainder of the division of the date and the numbers of days in a week. That will tell us which day in the fourth week we are on.
