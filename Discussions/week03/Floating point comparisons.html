<p>Consider the following example from the Jshell tool (a Java command line tool that lets us play with Java code without having to write a full blown program):</p>
<pre>jshell&gt; 0.333 == 1.0/3.0;<br />$1 =&gt; false</pre>
<p>Because of the way floating point numbers are represented in a computer, these two numbers are not strictly equal, which is what the == operator is testing. The reason is that the bits used to represent those two numbers are different &nbsp;(the 0.333 and the result of the division operation).</p>
<p>So with floating point numbers, we have to decide how close two numbers need to be to each other before we call them essentially equal. And it will depend on the kind of application you're writing how precise you'll want to be.</p>
<p>So in the example above, let's say we only care about equality down to the thousandths place. &nbsp;The way to decide if they're close enough to be equal for our need is to subtract one from the other and make sure the difference is less than 1/1000.</p>
<pre><span>jshell&gt; Math.abs(0.333 - (1.0/3.0)) &lt; 0.001<br /></span><span>$2 ==&gt; true</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote a quick program to help visualize the difference in bits between 0.333 and 1.0/3.0:</p>
<pre>0.333   = 01011111011111100101010101111100<br />1.0/3.0 = 11010101010101010101010101111100</pre>
<p>If you remember from chapter 2 of the book, floating point numbers are stored differently than integers. There is actually some structure to the bits with floating point numbers. (That's the IEEE 754 standard that was mentioned, see section 2.9.1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, while these both represent numbers that are close to 1/3, the bits used to represent them are quite different. And that's why the == operator says they're not equal -- because it checks for bit for bit equality.</p>
<p>Characters and integers are whole numbers, and there's no need to have any sub-structure in the bits to represent them. So the == operator works on them just fine.</p>
