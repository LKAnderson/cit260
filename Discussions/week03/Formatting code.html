<p>There are lots of ways to do it, and there are as many different opinions about what looks nice as there are people in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From experience, a general rule to be followed is this: <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Don't hide important elements at the end of a line.</strong></span></p>
<p>Within a switch statement, the break statement is extremely important. I think it deserves its own line.</p>

<p><em>(My apologies to our other international students whose language I do not know.)</em></p>
<p>The point is that we become accustomed to reading by shape and context, rather than by the individual elements of the words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading code is exactly the same. I spend hours upon hours every week looking at code, both what I've written, and what others have written. I have come to see the expected shapes of different kinds of code. When code doesn't follow the expected shape, I have to slow down and really think about what it's saying.</p>
<p>It's why I can look at a student's code submission and immediately see the formatting problems. &nbsp;And it's also why I want you to learn to code in the generally accepted formats. Each language has its general conventions, and they're not the same between all languages. But since we're learning Java this semester, I'm teaching you the general Java conventions. If you progress on to learning other languages, you'll get to learn the "shape and form" of those languages, too.</p>
<p>So, after all that long theory of reading, the answer is still this: It's not a good idea to hide important elements of the code at the end of a line. There are very few examples (seriously, I can't think of any at all) of when having two statements on a single line is a good idea. The benefits of whitespace in source code far outweigh the cost of a few extra bytes it adds to your file.</p>
