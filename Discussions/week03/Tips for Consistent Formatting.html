<h2>Tips for consistent source code formatting</h2>
<p>As there are still some who are having trouble with source code formatting, here are some tips to help you.</p>
<h3>When to Indent</h3>
<p>Add a new indent level after every opening brace, and reduce the indent level after every closing brace.</p>
<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%;"><span style="color: #0000aa;">if</span> (a == <span style="color: #009999;">1</span>) {
    <span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic;">// Add an indent level here</span>
}
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic;">// Remove an indent level here</span></pre>
<h3>How to Indent</h3>
<p>Always indent using the same method. If you like hitting the Tab key to indent, always hit the tab key (you can configure your editor to insert spaces when you hit the tab key, which is what I recommend).</p>
<p>If you like typing the spaces yourself, always use the space bar to indent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is when you mix both tabs and spaces that your code starts to have real problems. It might look fine to you, but when I pull it up in my editor that may have different settings than your editor, it will look bad and I do take points off for this.</p>
<h3>Auto-format</h3>
<p>Eclipse (and all other similar tools) has a Source --&gt; Format menu option that will reformat your file for you with the standard Java formatting guidelines. Before submitting your file, you should consider using this formatting tool to make sure your code is consistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend you do not "fight against" the formatter to have your own personalized coding style. You don't want to spend half your career reformatting code.</p>
<h3>Turn on Whitespace Rendering</h3>
<p>Eclipse (and most other similar tools) have an option to show you the whitespace characters. While I would go nuts if it was always turned on, I do use it when things seem to be wonky, so I can get stuff out of the way. You can see where there might be a tab character hiding out amidst your spaces.</p>
