<p>Correct. The relational operators (as we call them, since they test for a specific relationship between two items of data) work on any kind of data. The result will be an indication of whether that relationship exists between those two items. So, "whether or not" is either yes or no, or true or false.<br /><br />So...&nbsp;<br /><br />1 &lt; 3 is true<br />4 &gt;= 15 is false<br />"cat" == "dog" is false<br /><br />Java will complain if you try to compare two values that don't naturally compare to each other.&nbsp;<br /><br />1 &lt; "cat" doesn't make sense, you'll get an error in your source code.&nbsp;</p>
