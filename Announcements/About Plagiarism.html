<p>The Internet is a wonderful place, where you can find pretty much anything you want. There are websites, such as Stack Overflow, that provide answers to programming questions. There are blog posts that show how to do things in programming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, there are websites that contain solutions to all of the programming exercises in our text book. Sadly, I have seen a few of these published solutions submitted by students. Early on, our programming assignments were simple enough that there just weren't too many different ways to solve them. But we are now to the point where there can be a lot of creativity in how something is done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>So, can I not look anything up on the Internet while I'm a student?</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course you can! Read it, understand it, make sure you know how and why it works. Then go and write your own code using the knowledge and understanding you have just acquired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not copy or transcribe any other person's work and claim it as your own. That is the definition of plagiarism. Assignments where I can be sure a submission is not a student's own work will result in a 0 for the assignment and a possible referral to the Honor Office. A good grade means nothing if you can't actually demonstrate understanding afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have questions about what is permissible, please ask me.</p>
