<p>So Week 1 is in the history books and we're moving into Week 2. I hope you enjoyed your work last week. From your comments and assignment submissions, I think many of you did actually enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Notes from Last Week</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of items of experience from last week.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a&nbsp;<em>very</em> diverse class in terms of locations, time zones, experience, majors and reasons for taking this class. I am very impressed with how you have interacted already with each other in the Getting To Know You activity and in the technical discussion board. Since we won't be doing group work until the very end of the semester, the discussion boards are the primary way we will have to interact with each other. Programming is best done in collaboration with others (to varying degrees), so please get used to asking and responding on the discussion boards.</li>
<li>When doing the assignments, you should<strong> consider the assignment description as the requirements for your program</strong>. If the requirement specifies a specific output, or format, or name of a variable, etc. then please adhere to the requirement. I will take points off for not meeting the specification. This is how we have to work as developers. If you want to change a requirement, the "stakeholder" (or owner of the requirement) has to agree to it, or they won't accept the work you give them.</li>
<li><strong>Teach One Another Quiz</strong> - There is a question in the self-assessment quiz that asks what you did to teach someone else&nbsp;<em>outside</em> of the discussion boards. <strong>You may leave this question blank</strong> and I will give you credit for it based on your activity in the discussion boards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Multiple Discussion Boards - Besides the weekly discussion board, we also have our <a title="Let's Talk" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/487964" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/487964" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Let's Talk</a> and <a title="Meaningful Scriptures" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/487976" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/487976" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Meaningful Scriptures</a> discussion boards that you can use to post and respond if you can't come up with anything to post to the weekly board. <strong>If you contribute more than just a "I agree", or "Thank you" post to any discussion board, you can give yourself full credit on the self-assessment quiz</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>Last week, we wrote three programs that all used a Java API (or standard library) method to print <em>string literals</em> (or, "hard coded" strings) to the console. This week we're learning about how to use variables to store values in our program that we can reuse.&nbsp;<strong>A variable is an identifier (or a name) given to a location in memory so that you can remember it more easily.</strong> Variables have a data type associated with them so that the computer can know how you want it to interpret the value stored in the memory location associated with the identifier.</p>
<p>There are integers <strong>(byte, short, int, long)</strong> and real numbers <strong>(float, double)</strong>, true/false <strong>(boolean)</strong>, single-letter characters <strong>(char)</strong> and <strong>strings</strong> (you already know about these). In addition to these "primitive" types, we have object types (such as Date). Really, Strings in Java are not technically primitive types, but are actually objects. That will be important to remember later.</p>
<p>Computers don't do much more than, well, compute. Variables (and the identifiers we give to them) allow us to express some very complex computations in terms that are easy to read.</p>
<h3>Some Pro Tips</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of tips from the trenches that might make a difference for you this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although identifiers can start with a '$', we just don't do this in Java. It actually makes things harder to read, and it makes your code look like a Linux Bash script.</li>
<li>Give your variables descriptive names. Not too short, not too long. Single-letter names are only appropriate in short for-loops as the loop counter (eg, for (int i=0; i &lt; 3; i++)...), and in&nbsp;<em>very</em> well-known mathematical formulas where everyone knows what the letters mean (eg, a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>, the Pythagorean theorem). Other than these situations, please give your variable a name that describes what it holds. For example, a variable containing today&rsquo;s date could be given the name "today" or "todaysDate" (apostrophes are not allowed in Java identifiers).</li>
<li>Although Java allows us to declare multiple variables on the same line of code (eg, int var1 = 5, var2 = 6), we've collectively decided as an industry that this makes things harder to read later, so we just don't do it. Each variable deserves it's own line.</li>
<li>Pay attention to Section 2.18 in the chapter. There are some good pitfalls there. If you happen to fall into any other pits during your work this week, please post it to the discussion board!</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that's enough reading for one announcement. Have fun this week! Ask questions and get answers!</p>
