    <h2>Exam Info</h2>
    <p>By the end of this week, you will have seen everything this introductory course intends to show you. <em>You should congratulate yourself. Great job making it this far!</em> You'll gain mastery of it all as you practice it and get more experience with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Exam #2</strong> is this week. It consists of <strong>35 multiple choice questions</strong> and covers the material from the second half of the semester. It has a <strong>2 hour time limit</strong>. You'll also want to know stuff from the first half of the semester, as it everything in programming builds on itself. In particular, you will want to make sure you've got a good understanding of the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pass by value and pass by reference, and which types of data are passed by value and which are passed by reference.</li>
    <li>How passing by reference actually works in Java.</li>
    <li>The Java File class and what you can do with it.</li>
    <li>Java Exceptions, and how they are thrown and caught, and what that finally clause does.</li>
    <li>Arrays, ArrayLists and the types and how loops work with them.</li>
    <li>As always, you'll need to be able to see what code is valid Java and what is not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are some tips I have for taking the test:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Don't overthink the questions. They're intended to test your understanding, but not to trick you.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>You will want to keep the Javadocs from Oracle handy. They will help you answer some questions, so knowing how to find what you're looking for will save you some time.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>JShell is a helpful tool to have handy, too. You'll need JDK 9 or newer in order to use it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As with the first exam, this exam is open book, open Internet, open Eclipse/JShell/etc. But it is not open friend. You need to do your own research and answer the questions using your own understanding.</p>
    <p>Please do not discuss test questions in the discussion boards, or in any other medium with other students in the class. If you have concerns with a question, you may contact me directly via e-mail (<a href="mailto:andersonkent@byui.edu">andersonkent@byui.edu</a>).</p>
    <p>Good luck! You've all got this!</p>
    <h2>Assignment Re-do Opportunity</h2>
    <p>This has been on my mind lately and I feel that it needs to be offered this semester. If you want, you have a chance to fix some low scores from earlier in the semester. You have a choice:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Drop your lowest programming assignment score. It will not be used in your final grade calculation.<br />-OR-</li>
    <li>Re-submit up to two programming assignments to be graded again. If you choose this option, you need to tell me which assignment(s) you want to re-do, and I will give you one additional requirement for each assignment that you will need to incorporate. It will be something that you have learned during the class since that week.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is optional. If you are satisfied with your grade, you don't need to do anything. If you take option #2, you will need to fit this work among the other work required for the class. Once you have the additional requirements from me, you have up until the last day of the class to turn them in. <strong>The last day of class is Friday, April 12th.</strong></p>
    <p>If you want to take advantage of this opportunity, email me at <a href="mailto:andersonkent@byui.edu">andersonkent@byui.edu</a>.</p>
    <h2>Office Hours on Thursday This Week</h2>
    <p>I will be traveling for work this week and will be in San Antonio, Texas until Wednesday evening. I have <strong>rescheduled the office hour call for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thursday</span> this week, at 7:30pm Mountain Time</strong>. As always, you can reach me via discussion boards, email and phone/text (623-210-1219).</p>
    <h2>Java Error Handling - Exceptions</h2>
    <p>This is a long announcement already. I will put the information about Exceptions and Files in the <a title="W11 Discussion: Chapter 12" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460820" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460820" data-api-returntype="Discussion">W11 Discussion: Chapter 12</a>&nbsp;discussion board.</p>
    <h2>Assignment Extra Credit</h2>
    <p>This week's assignment includes doing both Programming Exercises 12.2 and 12.3. I will offer you extra credit points (5 points) if you create a common class that can be used by both 12.2 and 12.3. Here's a tip: Do 12.2 and then see what could be "factored" out into its own class and called by both assignments.&nbsp;</p>
