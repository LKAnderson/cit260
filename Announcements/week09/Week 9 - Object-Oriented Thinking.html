    <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Note: Week 9 = Chapter 10. Such a mental exercise to keep this straight!</span></em></span></p>
    </div>
    <p>This week is an extension of last week. The chapter is structured similarly as last week, too. The author discusses the principles of <strong>abstraction</strong> and <strong>encapsulation</strong>, and then provides ample case studies to help illustrate the points.</p>
    <p>There is only one programming exercise this week. It is very similar to exercise 9.1 from last week. You got this!</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Our Office Hour Call is on Thursday this week. This is due to a conflict in my schedule on Wednesday night.</strong></span></p>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is nothing more than describing the data and actions associated with the real-world things we need to model in our programs to solve some problem.</p>
    <p>For example, if we expand on our Family class from last week, the family is made of up of individual people. A person has a name, a gender, and a date of birth, from which we can calculate their age. Check out the UML for these relationships:</p>
    <p><img src="https://byui.instructure.com/users/39437/files/8123428/preview?verifier=f9aneqbe5aVD2vUEXO0GbIierey3qnTILemBHlie" alt="FamilyModel.svg" width="701" height="264" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/users/39437/files/8123428" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
    <p><em><strong>Abstraction is the process of breaking down our real world objects into describable parts that we can code in software.</strong>&nbsp;</em>As you can see between last week and this week, we can further refine our abstraction until it solves the problems we're needing to solve with our software. Notice that there are still aspects of a family that we don't model, such as which child is the favorite. (Just kidding!)</p>
    <p>Our abstractions doesn't have to try to model every detail we can ever think of. That would be like trying to boil the ocean with a hot plate. We only need to describe the things that help us solve the problems our software needs to solve.</p>
    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is the principle of not worrying about how things are implemented. This is from the perspective of the&nbsp;<em>user</em> of the class. The&nbsp;<em>author</em> of the class cares very much about how it is implemented. But the author can tell the user that the way the person's age is calculated is none of their business, so long as the answer provided by the getAge() method is correct.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the code for our Family model in the <a title="Week 9 Code Samples" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/669892" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/669892" data-api-returntype="Discussion">Week 9 Code Samples</a>.</p>
    <h2>"Contract"</h2>
    <p>Abstraction and Encapsulation combine to create a "contract" between the implementer and the user of a class. The contract (or interface) of the class describes how the class works. This is where the documentation for the class methods becomes important.</p>
    <h2>Good old Pythagorus (he had this theorem)</h2>
    <p>You'll need to use the Pythagorean theorem this week in order to calculate the distance between two points. The theorem is, for right triangles, the sides are related to each other like this: a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The distance between two points on a graph is the hypotenuse, or "c", of a right triangle. So if we can find the length of the other two sides of the triangle (the "a" and "b"), we can easily find the "c" like this:</p>
    <pre>double c = Math.sqrt( (a*a) + (b*b) );</pre>
    <p>You can find "a" and "b" by subtracting the x and y coordinates from each point:</p>
    <pre>double a = point1.x - point2.x;<br />double b = point1.y - point2.y;<br /><br /></pre>
    <h2>The D.R.Y. Principle</h2>
    <p>There is a principle in software development known as the DRY principle. It is an acronym that stands for <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our assignment this week will include writing two methods that both return the distance between two points. You only want to write that Pythagorean stuff once. You'll need to figure out how to reuse it for the second method.</p>
    <h2>Finally, some more Java API Classes</h2>
    <p>The chapter spends some more time introducing you to some more of the standard Java classes that we use a lot. Finally there's some talk of the BigDecimal class. There is a StringBuilder class that we use a lot, and they talk about how to split strings, which I demonstrated in my Week 7 code samples, too.</p>
    <p>You'll want to get familiar with these classes, as they will help you become more productive by doing a lot of the basic, tedious, and tricky stuff for us.</p>
