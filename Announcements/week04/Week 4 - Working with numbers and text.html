    </div>
    <p>This week's lesson is about working with the methods found in the <strong><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html">Math</a></strong> class. <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>DON'T PANIC: This is&nbsp;<em>not</em> a math class. You don't have to memorize any formulas.</strong></span> Just become familiar with the functions that are available in the Math class.</p>
    <p>Our chapter also introduces the basics of working with text in our programs. We'll be getting familiar with the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>char</strong></span> data type, and the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html"><strong>Character</strong></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"><strong>String</strong></a> classes.</p>
    <h2><strong>We know enough to be creative</strong></h2>
    <p>With this week's topics, we now know enough to afford us some creativity in the way we solve the problems in the programming exercises. <strong><span style="color: #008000;">I'm looking forward see how you solve the problems.</span></strong> These exercises will require quite a bit of thought in order to solve them.</p>
    <p>From this point on, <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>all of your programs need to check for invalid user input.</strong></span> I'll be throwing some invalid data at your programs to see how they handle it.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Assignment Rubrics</h2>
    <p>Our pilot course does not provide a rubric for the programming exercises. I have been using my own rubric to make sure I am consistent and fair in my grading. I've added official rubrics to the remainder of the lessons in the course.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For each programming exercise, I evaluate your work on a scale from 0 to 10 in the following three areas.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>(40%) Correct implementation of the requirement. The description of the programming exercise is our requirement. I am looking for how closely your code matches the requirement(s) given for the exercise.</li>
    <li>(55%) Demonstrated mastery of the week's subject matter. I want to see that you understand what we've been learning each week.</li>
    <li>(5%) Consistent and appropriate code formatting.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, it is expected that you will compile and test your program before submitting it. If you submit code that does not compile or run, you will lose 50% of your score. I do give you partial credit for the work you put in, but if your code does not compile or run, it is not acceptable as a submission.</p>
    <h2>Whitespace and Indentation Settings in Eclipse</h2>
    <p>The following video will help you see, one and for all, how to get Eclipse to indent your code the way you want, without any surprise tab or space characters where you don't expect them.</p>
