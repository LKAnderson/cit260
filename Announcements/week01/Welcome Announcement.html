<p>Hello, and welcome to class!</p>
<p>My name is&nbsp;Brother Kent Anderson&nbsp;and I am excited to be your course instructor this semester. I'd like to take a minute of your time and introduce myself to you.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="https://byui.instructure.com/users/39437/files/5917488/preview?verifier=lUtAfKLf8Mbm5T2FUXV27JJX9PspkQg9m4yBBIsb" alt="Picture of Brother Anderson's Family" width="418" height="209" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/users/39437/files/5917488" data-api-returntype="File" />My wife, Christine, and I live in Peoria, Arizona, where we have raised our five children. Our three sons have served missions for the Church in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. We have two high school aged daughters still at home, and of course, they keep us busy. Our oldest son, Michael, just graduated from BYU-Idaho this summer and less than a week later married his sweetheart, Kjerstin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine and I met at BYU in Provo, in a family home evening group. Although it might be considered a clich&eacute;, that was more than 27 years ago, and we are happier together today than we've ever been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the third of eleven children, and I grew up in Lubbock, Texas.</p>
<h2>Faith</h2>
<p>I am very happy to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was fortunate enough to be born into a family that knows and loves the restored gospel. I served a mission for the Church in Chihuahua, Mexico, from 1988 to 1990.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have served in various callings over the years, and I am currently serving as the stake technology specialist and assistant stake clerk. I enjoy serving the Lord in whatever way He calls me to serve.</p>
<p>I have a strong testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I love the Church and I support its teachings and standards. I look forward to hearing your testimonies and insights this semester, as well as sharing a few things I've come to appreciate over the years. You may wonder how computer programming and spirituality interact with each other. I can tell you, as with probably anything else, they are intertwined in ways you will be amazed to discover.</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>I graduated from BYU in 1994 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.&nbsp;I have been a professional software developer for more than 20 years. I started working as a programmer while still at BYU in Provo. After graduating, I stayed on as a full-time programmer at the University for a few more years. Eventually, Christine and I decided it was time to spread our wings a little wider, so we moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area in July 1997, and we have lived here ever since. Over my professional career, I have worked in educational financial operations, telecommunications, financial transaction processing, auto parts, aerospace and avionics, and now, insurance. I currently work at USAA in Phoenix. We do a lot of Java work, and my team's current project is developing a mobile app for iOS and Android. One of the things I love about my profession is getting to know all about the industries I am working in as I develop software tools for people&nbsp;to use to make their lives better.</p>
<p>Computer programming is an extremely creative process. This creativity is one of the things I enjoy most about the work I do. Mastery of the tools of the trade will allow your creativity to flourish. It takes discipline and effort to master these tools, so be patient, and be diligent. You will get there. I promise!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am excited to be your instructor this semester! I can't wait to get started.</p>
<p>And now for a little fun... If this kid can turn out OK, anyone can!</p>
