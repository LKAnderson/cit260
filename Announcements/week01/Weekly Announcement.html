<p>We have quite a lot to do this first week! Please carefully read this whole announcement. The success of your mission (this semester) depends on it :-)</p>
<h3><strong>Syllabus</strong></h3>
<p>You can find the <a title="Syllabus" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/assignments/syllabus">syllabus</a> here in Canvas. It is available using the links on the left. Please read through it and get familiar with what we are doing this semester.</p>
<h3><strong>The Textbook</strong></h3>
<p>Our textbook for the class is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong class="">Introduction to Java Programming</strong></span><strong class="">, Liang, 11th Edition&nbsp;</strong><strong class="">(ISBN&nbsp;9780134671727)</strong>. This book is required this semester as we will be following it closely each week, and the programming assignments are taken from the book.</p>
<p>Our course is configured to provide the book to you as an Auto-Access book, which means you'll be billed for it after the add deadline (Week 2) in your University account, and you will have access to it via Canvas. You do not need to purchase any other copy of the book (unless you want to). If you do not have access to the book once class starts, please contact me.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Zoom Video Conferencing</h3>
<p>BYU-Idaho uses Zoom (<a href="http://www.zoom.us">www.zoom.us</a>) for online video conferencing. All BYU-I students have pro accounts with Zoom as well, so you will be able to use it for your team meetings if you want to. If you find that your Zoom meetings are time-limited, please contact the Online Service Center to get details on how to access the account they have created for you. You need not feel like a second class citizen on Zoom. You're no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the faculty in Zoom! ;-)</p>
<p>You will be free to use any collaboration tools you want in the class. I will be using Zoom for office hours meetings.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Getting to Know You Post</strong></h3>
<p>We have a <a title="W01 Discussion: Getting to Know You" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/assignments/921501" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/assignments/921501" data-api-returntype="Assignment">"getting to know you" assignment</a> due this week on Wednesday (1/9). Please record a short video introduction of yourself (I recommend Zoom, but you can use anything you're comfortable with). If you can remember, try to include where you live and what time zone it's in.</p>
<h3><strong>Discussion Boards</strong></h3>
<p>There are several good websites on the Internet where developers can ask questions and get answers from their peers. We have our own class developer forum, where you must&nbsp;post either a question, or something you&nbsp;have learned that can help the class. You must also participate in the forum by responding to others' posts.</p>
<p>The developer forum is where you help each other. Although I will monitor the forum, I want you to help teach each other. I will contribute to the forum to fill in gaps and perhaps to provide additional insights into topics of discussion.</p>
<p>You will evaluate your own participation in the Developer Forum by taking a quiz at the end of each week. I trust all of you will give your effort an accurate assessment for the week. If you find you are struggling to contribute to the weekly forum in a meaningful way, please contact me and I can give you some ideas.</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Programming Assignment</strong></h3>
<p>There is a programming assignment due this week, on Saturday. You'll be writing three short programs.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Learning Summary</strong></h3>
<p>This is a short written reflection of your week in our class. Honestly, reading these summaries is one of the highlights of my week, so please don't ignore this seemingly small detail of the class. It is your chance to let me know how you think things are going.</p>
<h3><strong>Late Work Policy</strong></h3>
<p>The CIT Department's late policy is that nothing can be accepted late, except due to illness. I understand that sometimes life happens and you might need to choose to give other things a higher priority once in a while. <strong>My late policy is to deduct 15% for each day it is late, up to a week</strong>. Assignments will not be accepted later than one week from the due date. If Canvas has closed the submissions for the assignment, you should contact me to open an exception for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Pilot Course</strong></h3>
<p>As I said in the email last week, we are excited to be piloting a new curriculum this semester. As will all things at version 1.0, there are bound to be some loose ends. Please ask questions, and don't make any assumptions. As instructors, we've been over this material so many times that we might now be a bit blind to the little details. If you'll ask questions when things don't seem right, we can clarify for you, and fix the course wherever it needs it.</p>
