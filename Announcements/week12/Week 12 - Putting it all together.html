    <h2>At long last!</h2>
    <p>If you don't have the print copy of the text book, you might not appreciate how much ground we've covered in the last 11 weeks. We've covered 496 pages of the text book! And since I've tried to introduce abstract classes and interfaces in our office hours calls, we've pretty much covered chapter 13, too, so make that <strong>540 pages of a very technical book</strong>!</p>
    <p>Add to that the <strong>hundreds of PowerPoint slides</strong>, <strong>1374 discussion board posts (and counting!)</strong>, who knows how <strong>many hours in Office Hours recordings</strong>, and <strong>countless hours in front of your computer</strong>, giving it commands to do what you want it to do. And for many of you, this is only one of the classes you're taking this semester.</p>
    <p>Give yourself a pat on the back. You've done well!&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Week 12 - Back to Spiritual Creation</h2>
    <p>Yes, we're going back to Spiritual Creation (also known as <em>software&nbsp;</em><em>design</em>) this week. Your assignment is to design the data classes you will use for your program. You will then design the user interaction with your program, known as the "functional specification," or "requirements" of your program. This is how your program will work from the user's perspective.</p>
    <p>You know everything you need to know to do the class diagram. It should be UML, and you are free to use any of the shortcuts I have demonstrated in my UML this semester (for example, a "{ get set }" after a property in the data section so you don't have to type a getter and setter in the method section). Your design needs to show a base class with at least two child classes. You also need to make it clear which method(s) you're going to use for polymorphism (same method, different implementations).</p>
    <h3>Functional Specification</h3>
    <p>The functional spec, or requirements, for your program should describe how the program will interact with the user to carry out the functions of the program. For interactive programs such as this project, it is helpful to follow a simple recipe for your specification:</p>
    <div style="margin: 1em 2em; padding: 1em; background-color: #efefef; border: 1px solid #000;">
    <p>1. Describe what the computer displays to the user, including any choices the user needs to make.</p>
    <p>2. Describe how the user will enter their choice, or input.</p>
    <p>3. Describe what the computer will do in response to user's input.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Obviously, the more detailed your spiritual creation is, the easier it will be to write the code. This is because you're putting in the work ahead of time to make decisions about how you want things to work. If you put off making these kinds of decisions, you'll end up having to make these decisions at the same time you're having to make coding decisions, and that tends to drain the brain very quickly!</p>
    <p>I have attached a Sample Functional Specification document as an example. This example is from the previous version of the course, where students had to develop a very complex game during the semester. <strong>Your projects will not be this complex</strong>. However, it provides an example of an appropriate level of detail and organization for your document.</p>
    <p>Your program will have fewer features, and therefore fewer interactions with the user to describe. Your UML diagram will be much smaller, too.</p>
    <p><strong>Please submit your document in <span style="color: #008000;">PDF format</span> to ensure it looks like you intended it to look when I view it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <h2>Get Started Early</h2>
    <p>The sooner you get this work done during the week, the better you will be. You have just over 2 1/2 weeks from now to finish the project. You can do it. But getting an early start is a good idea.</p>
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>This week's design work can easily be done using Zoom and a shared document tool such as Office 365 or Google Docs.</p>
    <p>During the week, I will be testing out the Eclipse extension we mentioned in the office hour call last week. If you want to volunteer to help me test it out, send me an email (<a href="mailto:andersonkent@gmail.com">andersonkent@byui.edu).</a></p>
    <p>You are free to use any collaboration tool you want. If both parties in your group are familiar with git (such as GitHub), you can use it. However, if you are not familiar with it, I don't recommend trying to use it at this point. It has a steep learning curve and you don't need any distractions to pull you away from the real work of the project.</p>
    <h2>Instructor Feedback</h2>
    <p>By the end of this week, you should be given a link to the form where you can provide feedback about me as the instructor of the course. I encourage you to take a few minutes and give me your honest feedback. I read it, and I try each semester to do better than I did before. I can't do that without your input. The feedback is anonymous so you can say what you really want to say.</p>
