    <h2>Sample Completed Project</h2>
    <p>First, attached to this announcement is a Zip file containing my own final project. It is the completed version of the project I posted last week. It meets all of the rubric elements required for the project (see <a title="W14 Submission: Final Project" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/assignments/921729" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/assignments/921729" data-api-returntype="Assignment">W14 Submission: Final Project</a>).</p>
    <h2>Words of Encouragement</h2>
    <p>All I have left to give you is some encouragement. You have learned and practiced everything you need to know to complete this work. You might be feeling inadequate, but that is just not true. You can do this. You're not expected to be perfect, and you might still need some guidance to know how certain things can be done.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please take a look at the sample project I have attached. It shows how to do a lot of things your projects will need to do. If you have questions that don't seem to be answered, please ask me. You can text me (623-210-1219), or post in the <a title="W13 Discussion: Final Project Work" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460818" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460818" data-api-returntype="Discussion">W13 Discussion: Final Project Work</a>, which I will leave open until the end of the course.</p>
    <p>It has been my pleasure being your instructor this semester. I am so impressed with all of you for all you have done to be able to succeed in this course.</p>
    <p>I wish you all the best in your future studies and endeavors.</p>
