<p>In case you need a reminder, the final project is <strong>due this Friday, at 11:59pm Mountain Time</strong>.</p>
<p>I've been very pleased with what was submitted for Week 13. You're all in a good position to finish this project. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you finish this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of the very short window available to me to grade the projects and submit final grades, I cannot accept late work on this project. It needs to be submitted by the deadline.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>If you run out of time, get your project to a stable point and submit what you have. Partial credit is way better than no credit at all.</li>
<li>You code has to compile without any errors. The usual policy applies that has been in place for the whole semester. If the code doesn't compile, the best you can get is 50% credit.<br /><br /></li>
<li>When you submit your project, feel free to zip up your project from the root of your project (ie, the directory that contains the src and bin directories, if you're working in Eclipse). As long as your project is a valid java project, I'll be able to build it and run it.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Only the Java code needs to be submitted. You do not need to re-submit your UML or requirements documents. However, you should double check that your project actually meets the requirements you set for yourself.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Only one team member needs to submit the project files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm getting really excited for you to finish the class. I have loved teaching you. Thank you for sticking with the class. If you remember, this was a pilot semester where we rolled out a new curriculum and we've been watching for things that need adjusting. If you didn't take the chance to submit feedback about the course, please feel free to email me your feedback and I will pass it along to the course council.</p>
<p>Good luck, everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love you!</p>
