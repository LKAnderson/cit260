<p>As we move into the latter half of the week and you'll soon be working on assignments, if you haven't started already. This week's lesson includes selection statements (if, else, switch).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your solutions will need to check for invalid inputs and end the program gracefully if I input something invalid (no ugly exception traces).</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, I will enter negative numbers to make sure you are handling them correctly.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please ask them in the discussion board, or bring them to the Weekly call tonight (Wednesday) at 7:30pm Mountain time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't make it, and you still have a question, please send it to me ahead of time, and I'll address it during the call so you can see the answer in the recording.</p>
