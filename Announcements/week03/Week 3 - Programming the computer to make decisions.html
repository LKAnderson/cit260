<p>As usual, all of this is due by midnight on Saturday (Mountain Time).</p>
<p><strong>Note that your programming assignments this week must handle invalid inputs.</strong> Don't worry, you'll know how to do it by the time you finish reading the chapter.</p>
<p>Based on the response from the quick survey, it looks like we're about 50/50 on the 6:30 vs 7:30 time for the<strong> Wednesday Office Hours</strong> call. Based on that, I think <strong>we're going to leave it as it is (at 7:30pm Mountain)</strong> time. When daylight savings time starts, 6:30pm will become 5:30pm for me and that might be hard to get home in time from work. If it was clearly advantageous for the whole class, I could make it work, but as it is, let's just keep things at 7:30pm.</p>
</div>
<p>Ok, printing stuff out and doing some math was cool and all, but now we're finally getting to where the computer proves it's more than just an expensive calculator. We're going to program it to make some decisions for us.</p>
<p>In programming language terms, decision making is known as "selection." The code is selecting different blocks of code to run based on certain conditions you ask it to test. At the heart of all logic in computers (and in electrical engineering) is the&nbsp;<strong>boolean</strong> value, which can either be <strong>1</strong> or <strong>0</strong>, or <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong>, and in Java, it's&nbsp;<strong>true</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's funny to think that with all the complexities of computers and the things they are able to do for us in our day and age, the only real decision making ability they have is the ability to tell whether a value is true or false. But, oh, how we make use of that simple principle in some fantastic ways!</p>
<p>I won't repeat Chapter 3 of the text book here for you. <strong>You definitely need to read the chapter this week, and I recommend you start early</strong>. Logic can be mind-bending, and if your mind is not practiced with it, it will take some getting used to. I expect there will be many questions in the discussion board this week.</p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>Here are some tips that might make your study a little more efficient and effective this week.</p>
<div style="width: 95%; background-color: #a1d490; border: 2px solid black; padding: 1em;">
<p><strong>Tip #1 - Modulo (remainder) arithmetic</strong></p>
<p>When we divide numbers that are of type double, we get a result that is a double. The nice thing about double (and float) is that they hold <strong>fractions</strong>. So 9.0 / 5 = 1.8 (or 1 and 4/5).</p>
<p>But with integers, we only get whole numbers. So 9 / 5 = 1, and we lose the rest of the number. Not cool. (Ok, it&nbsp;<em>can</em> be cool, but you need to know what you're doing with it.)</p>
<p>All programming languages support the&nbsp;<strong>modulo operator</strong> to provide the ability to get the remainder when doing integer division. So, as 9 / 5 = 1, 9 modulo 5 = 4 (the remainder).</p>
<p>In Java, the modulo operation is represented as a <strong>%</strong>. 9 <strong>%</strong> 5 = 4. (Don't confuse this with the % sign used inside strings when producing formatted output.)</p>
<p>Modulo division is extremely useful in many programming situations. We're going to get a feel for it this week in our assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Tip #2 - Order of precedence in mathematical and logical expressions</strong></p>
<p>Section 3.15 in the chapter is super important. There are many subtle bugs that arise because programmers forget about order of precedence in their expressions. I highly recommend you get familiar with this section. Of course, you can force certain calculations to happen first if you'll wrap them in parentheses. That helps the computer know what you mean with all those terms.</p>

<p><strong>Tip #3 Debugging</strong></p>
<p>Now that we're asking the computer to do some decision making for us, the debugger is going to become your favorite tool. Help me remember this week, and I'll make sure to give another demonstration of the debugger in the Wednesday Office Hour call.</p>
