<p>You're on the final approach and you're lined up with the runway!</p>
<p>All that's left to do to finish the class is to code up your creation.</p>
<h2>What's due this week?</h2>
<p>What you need to do this week is code up all of the classes that will make up your program. There is an emphasis on commenting your code well. You should identify every class and the fields and methods in each class that will be needed, but you do not need to have every method coded by the end of the week. You can have pseudocode comments in them if you don't have actual code. (Next week will be where everything gets implemented).</p>
<h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
<p>The discussion board is still a thing this week. There's a self-reporting quiz at the end of the week, just like always.</p>
<p>Feel free to post screenshots of code you're struggling with. As we saw last week, a student posted some UML and asked some questions about it. The feedback was helpful to a lot more than just the student who was courageous enough to post it. Nobody is judging your questions or your code.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>I am interested to know how each team is planning to collaborate. Please take a minute and respond to the discussion board thread about Collaboration in the <a title="W13 Discussion: Final Project Work" href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460818" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/37376/discussion_topics/460818" data-api-returntype="Discussion">W13 Discussion: Final Project Work </a>board.</p>
<p>One of the things I will ask you to provide with your final submission next week is to let me know whether you feel the work was fairly distributed between the team members. It is important that each team member do their share and meet their commitment to their team member. Please do all you can to help each other over the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you believe it? You're almost done with this class!</p>
<h2>Course Evaluation</h2>
<p>You're probably all surveyed out by now, but there is one more that we're going to ask you to fill out. This one is about our course. This was a special semester because we have been piloting our new curriculum. We really want your feedback about how you feel it has gone, and what recommendations you have for the course in future semesters.</p>
<p>You should see a link to the survey in the Week 13 module. If you are unable to access it by Friday of this week, please let me know.</p>
<h2>Good luck!</h2>
<p>You've got this! Ask for help early! Feel free to submit your assignment as early as you can and work ahead, if you want. You may submit your final project any time during Week 14. The absolute last day to turn it in will be Friday, April 12th.&nbsp;</p>
