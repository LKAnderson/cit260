Magic Numbers 
-------------

Nice job avoiding a magic number here.

One piece of advice would be to make this tax value a constant,
so it is not a magic number. You can do this by declaring a final 
variable with the value of 0.032.

This is not really a magic number, since it’s a commonly used
technique to convert to a fraction. So it’s ok to leave it as a 
literal value.
