Agenda
------

1. Setting Eclipse to use spaces instead of tabs.

2. Ensuring we're looking at the right place for assignments.

3. Q&A

    - Celsius & Fahrenheit - constants or literals? For our assignments 
      this week - literals are fine.
    
    - Are parentheses necessary? Sometimes - parentheses make your code 
      more precise and leave less to chance (when working with numeric 
      calculations).
     
4. Assignment Demonstration

    - Explanation of the Scanner class
    
    - Demonstration of using try() to clear the warning about Scanner 
      needing to be closed.
    
    - Demonstration of how to look up the documentation for a class on 
      the Oracle website.
    
    - Demonstration of the print, println, and printf methods on System.out.
    
    - Demonstration of Math.pow()
    
    - Demonstration of Inheritance (sub-classing), which is something you 
      can safely ignore until later in the semester. This wasn't the best 
      example to use for a discussion on inheritance, but we tried it anyway.
