AGENDA
======

1. Q&A

    - Console.WriteLine in the slides? (That's a typo and is actually C# code)
    - What is "package" in the code?
    - Indentation - what does it mean to be consistent?
    - Abnormal Exit? (System.exit(), and exceptions)
    - Eclipse, can it do HTML? Yes!
    

2. Demonstration (3.17 - Not on the assignment, but similar)

    - User input using Scanner (this time we call nextInt()
    - Validating user input using if-statements
    - Switch statements to get a string description of the integer input.
    - if-else-if statement for figuring out complex selections.
    - Discussion of Magic Numbers and how (and why) to avoid them.
