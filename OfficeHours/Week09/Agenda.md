## MyInteger Example (10.3 from the book)

### Requirements

Design a class named **MyInteger**. The class contains:

* An `int` data field named `value` that stores the `int` value represented
  by this object.
  
* A constructor that creates a `MyInteger` object for the specified `int` 
  value.
  
* A getter method that returns the `int` value.

* The methods `isEven()`, `isOdd()`, and `isPrime()` that return `true` if
  the value in this object is even, odd, or prime, respectively.

* The static methods `isEven(int)`, `isOdd(int)`, `isPrime(int)` that return
  `true` if the specified value is even, odd, or prime, respectively.

* The static methods `isEven(MyInteger)`, `isOdd(MyInteger)`, and `isPrime
  (MyInteger)` hat return `true` if the specified value is even, odd, or
  prime, respectively.

* The methods `equals(int)` and `equals(MyInteger)` that return `true` if the
  value in this object is equal to the specified value.

* A static method `parseInt(char[])` that converts an array of numeric
  characters into an `int` value.

* A static method `parseInt(String)` that converts a string into an `int`
  value.

Draw the UML diagram for the class then implement the class. Write a client
program that tests all methods in the class.

### Rubric

* Programs meet all of the requirements stated in the problem statement
* Programs correctly use the concepts taught during the week, as appropriate
* Programs compile and execute
* Programs meet style and documentation guidelines required by your instructor
